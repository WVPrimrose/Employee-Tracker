# Employee-Tracker

This project allows to use PSQL to store, read, and update data within databases and tables.

Here, we are shown three tables: departments(by id and title), role(title, salary, and the department which they belong in), and employee(first and last name, role, and manager).

We use inquirer to view, add, and update the following data:

* view departments, roles, and employees
* add departments, roles, and employees
* update employee role

The following walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality described from above.
